FeedParser
==========

FeedParser is a PHP library that handles all types of XML feeds. 

Example
-------

(Also, in feed.php)

```php
<?php

// The only thing we need is include base class file
require_once('FeedParser.php');

// Get XML serialization of feed
$xml = file_get_contents($_POST['filename']);

// This is great. To work with feed we invoke only base class. All other work is 
// transparent.
$feed = new FeedParser($xml);

//Because we have interface for feeds, we invoke interface methods
echo '<b>Type:</b>'.$feed->getFeedType()."<br/>";
echo '<b>Title:</b>'.$feed->getTitle()."<br/>";
echo '<b>Description:</b>'.$feed->getDescription()."<br/>";
echo '<b>Feed link:</b>'.$feed->getFeedLink()."<br/>";
echo '<b>Link:</b>'.$feed->getLink()."<br/>";

$items = $feed->getItems();

// Stuff in your items can be empty, so you should somehow handle it.
// I've prepared is_empty function for you - enjoy.
$i=1;
foreach($items as $item)
{
	//Because we have interface for items, we invoke interface methods
	echo "<h1>";
	if(is_empty($item->getLink()))
		echo '<a href="#">';
	else
		echo '<a href="'.$item->getLink().'">';

	if(is_empty($item->getTitle()))
		echo "No title";
	else
		echo "$i. ".$item->getTitle();
	echo "</a>";

	echo "</h1>";

	if(is_empty($item->getPubDate()))
		echo "<i>"."No date"."</i><br/>";
	else
		echo "<i>".$item->getPubDate()."</i><br/>";

	if(is_empty($item->getContent()))
		echo "<i>"."No content"."</i><br/>";
	else
		echo $item->getContent()."<hr/>";

	$i++;
}

?>
```

History
-------

I read a lot. I have about 100 RSS/Atom subscriptions, that i read every day.
It helps me to have actual knowledge and have fun. All feeds i read in google 
reader. However i didn’t like it much from the beginning because of small 
viewport. If you open google reader on small 1024×600 netbook screen you’ll 
understand what i’m talking about. For example, it’s really impossible to 
view photos.

That’s why i’ve decided to write my own reader and get practice in PHP/Yii.

So, if you want to read RSS/Atom, you have to parse it somehow. At first i 
wanted to use something already done and found XML_Feed_Parser library by 
James Stewart at PEAR. I’ve tried to fit it under my code, but despite all 
benefits, it wasn’t so “unified” as it was told in description. And 
that’s why I wrote my own library, based on James's work.
