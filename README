I read a lot. I have about 100 RSS/Atom subscriptions, that i read every day.
It helps me to have actual knowledge and have fun. All feeds i read in google 
reader. However i didn’t like it much from the beginning because of small 
viewport. If you open google reader on small 1024×600 netbook screen you’ll 
understand what i’m talking about. For example, it’s really impossible to 
view photos.

That’s why i’ve decided to write my own reader and get practice in PHP/Yii.

So, if you want to read RSS/Atom, you have to parse it somehow. At first i 
wanted to use something already done and found XML_Feed_Parser library by 
James Stewart at PEAR. I’ve tried to fit it under my code, but despite all 
benefits, it wasn’t so “unified” as it was told in description. And 
that’s why I wrote my own library, based on James's work.

with help of doxygen, you can see at http://finger.reduct.ru/FeedParserDocs

If you have any questions, suggestions or anything else – write me email to 
finger@reduct.ru or ask through github.
